In this project, I worked on analyzing the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website. The company developed a new web page with the goal of increasing the conversion rate, which refers to the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The objective of this project is to assist the company in making an informed decision regarding whether to implement the new page, retain the old page, or continue the experiment for a longer duration.

To complete this project, I used a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook guided me through the analysis process as the template given in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course.
